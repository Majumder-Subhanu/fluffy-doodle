/**
 * Cody-Jamal is working on his latest piece of abstract art: a mural consisting of a row of waning moons and closed umbrellas.
 * Unfortunately, greedy copyright trolls are claiming that waning moons look like an uppercase C and closed umbrellas look like a J,
 * and they have a copyright on CJ and JC. Therefore, for each time CJ appears in the mural, Cody-Jamal must pay X, and for each
 * time JC appears in the mural, he must pay Y.
 * Cody-Jamal is unwilling to let them compromise his art, so he will not change anything already painted.
 * He decided, however, that the empty spaces he still has could be filled strategically, to minimize the copyright expenses.
 * For example, if CJ?CC? represents the current state of the mural, with C representing a waning moon, J representing a closed
 * umbrella, and ? representing a space that still needs to be painted with either a waning moon or a closed umbrella, he could finish
 * the mural as CJCCCC, CJCCCJ, CJJCCC, or CJJCCJ. The first and third options would require paying X+Y in copyrights, while
 * the second and fourth would require paying 2â‹…X+Y.
 * Given the costs X and Y and a string representing the current state of the mural, how much does Cody-Jamal need to pay in copyrights
 * if he finishes his mural in a way that minimizes that cost?
